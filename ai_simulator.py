    # Each comment corresponds to a crucial step in developing a chess AI that could efficiently simulate positions,
    #  assess risks, and ultimately aim for checkmate. If you plan to implement this,
    #  consider breaking down each step into smaller functions for clarity and modularity.


    # The approach you've laid out is generally sound, but it is a high-level outline. To move from this outline to a fully functional AI for a chess game, 
    # several key aspects need further development and refinement:

    # ### Key Areas to Refine:

    # 1. **Move Generation (`get_legal_moves`)**:
    #    - This function needs to correctly generate all possible legal moves for each type of piece according to chess rules.
    #  This includes handling special moves like castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.

    # 2. **Risk Evaluation (`evaluate_risks`)**:
    #    - Risk assessment should take into account the possibility of counterattacks by the opponent. For each potential move,
    #  you should evaluate how the opponent could respond and the potential impact on your position. This could involve calculating a score for each position based on piece safety, control of the board, and proximity to checkmate.

    # 3. **King Check and Checkmate Detection**:
    #    - Implementing functionality to determine whether the opponent's king is in check, and whether a move leads to checkmate, 
    # is crucial. Without this, the AI won't be able to achieve its ultimate goal of winning the game.

    # 4. **Move Selection (`find_best_move`)**:
    #    - The current random selection of moves is very basic. A more sophisticated approach, such as using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning,
    #  would be needed to make intelligent decisions. This involves evaluating the potential consequences of each move several steps ahead,
    #  considering the opponent's best possible responses.

    # 5. **Capture Evaluation (`evaluate_capture_moves`)**:
    #    - Capturing opponent pieces is often beneficial, but the AI needs to evaluate whether capturing a piece will leave it vulnerable to a counterattack. 
    # The AI should consider the value of the pieces being captured versus the value of the pieces it risks losing.

    # 6. **Database Storage**:
    #    - Storing positions and evaluations in a database could be useful if you want to implement learning or reuse this information in future games. However, 
    # if you're aiming for a simpler AI, this step could be optional.

    # 7. **File Saving**:
    #    - Saving to a file is useful for debugging or later analysis, but it might not be necessary for every move in a real-time game unless you're 
    # building an AI that learns from its past experiences.

    # 8. **Updating the Visual Board**:
    #    - The code includes a placeholder for updating the visual board, but the actual implementation needs to correctly
    #  redraw the board with the new positions after each move.

    # ### Additional Considerations:

    # 1. **Performance**:
    #    - Chess AI can become computationally expensive, especially if you evaluate multiple layers of potential moves (lookahead). 
    # Optimizing the performance of your algorithms will be crucial for creating an AI that can respond quickly.

    # 2. **Game State Management**:
    #    - Ensure that your AI correctly tracks the state of the game, including the status of each piece, turn order, and any special 
    # conditions (e.g., whether a player is in check).

    # 3. **AI Strategy**:
    #    - The current outline doesnâ€™t include much about specific strategies or heuristics the AI might use. Beyond just evaluating moves,
    #  the AI might prioritize controlling the center, developing pieces, and maintaining king safety.

    # 4. **Handling Draw Scenarios**:
    #    - The AI should be able to recognize and handle scenarios that lead to a draw, such as stalemate, threefold repetition, and the fifty-move rule.

    # ### Conclusion:
    # Your approach is on the right track, but significant development is needed to implement the full functionality. Adding more detailed logic for move generation,
    #  risk evaluation, and strategic decision-making will be necessary to create an AI that plays chess effectively.
